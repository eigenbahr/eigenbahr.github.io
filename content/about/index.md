I'm a software engineer at the [National Snow and Ice Data 
Center (NSIDC)](https://nsidc.org). NSIDC is part of the [Cooperative Institute for Research in 
Environmental Sciences](https://cires.colorado.edu/) at the [University of Colorado Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu/).
I develop software for scientific data products, data analysis, and visualization.
I work mainly in Python, JavaScript / TypeScript, and develop both on-prem and cloud (AWS) deployed systems.
