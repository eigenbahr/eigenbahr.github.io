summary: Screencast demo of using `pyenv` to manage multiple virtualenvs, conda environments, and Python versions.
---

If you develop multiple Python projects each with their own version of Python, set of dependencies,
and use both virtualenvs and conda, then [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) is worth your time
to investigate and learn. Check out the short demo:

To get started, install both `pyenv` and `pyenv-virtualenv` and integrate them into your shell setup. 
Both have good installation instructions and are easy to get up and running:

* [Pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)
* [Pyenv-virtualenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv)
