As it was done for Python, so let it be done for functional
programming!

I've collected only the finest books, articles, videos, and other
sundry links into the new [Functional Programming](/fp) page. As with
Python, it is linked above in the navigation section.

Though some of these links are specific to JavaScript, I still think
them well worth reading. Similarly, there are more than a few links to
material from Scott Wlaschin on his site [F# for Fun and
Profit](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com). I consider most of his
material of interest and use in other languages; fear not the F#! In
fact, one appeal of functional programming is its almost universal
application in a wide variety of languages without much mental
translational drudgework. An understanding of function composition,
partial application, currying, and higher-order functions in one
language translates quite well to others.

Enjoy!
